PART A
The dataset income.data represents an extract from a commercial marketing database.
The goal is to fit a regression tree to predict the annual income of a household from 13 demographic
attributes and interpret the results and answer a few set of questions

PART B
One of the applications of the predictive methods is to automatically recognize letters, so
that post once machines use to sort mail. In this problem, we want to build a model that uses statistics
of images of four letters in the Roman alphabet A;B; P; and R to predict which letter a particular
image corresponds to.
The fle letters ABPR.csv" contains 3116 observations, each of which corresponds to a certain
image of one of the four letters A;B; P and R. The images came from 20 different fonts, which were
For each such distorted image, we have available
certain statistics of the image in terms of these pixels, as well as which of the four letters the image is.
This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Goal is to Construct the best possible decision tree and random forest models that predicts the class of each letter.
